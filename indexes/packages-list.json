Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution\n10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n11.

Script Source (Choose one):**\n*   `kb_script_id` (string): **Preferred.** Executes a pre-defined script from the knowledge base by its ID. Use `get_scripting_tips` to find IDs and inputs. Supports placeholder substitution via `input_data` or `arguments`. Ex: `kb_script_id: \"safari_get_front_tab_url\"`.\n*   `script_content` (string): Executes raw AppleScript/JXA code. Good for simple or dynamic scripts. Ex: `script_content: \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to empty trash\"`.\n*   `script_path` (string): Executes a script from an absolute POSIX path on the server. Ex: `/Users/user/myscripts/myscript.applescript`.\n\n**2. Script Inputs (Optional):**\n*   `input_data` (JSON object): For `kb_script_id`, provides named inputs (e.g., `--MCP_INPUT:keyName`). Values (string, number, boolean, simple array/object) are auto-converted. Ex: `input_data: { \"folder_name\": \"New Docs\" }`.\n*   `arguments` (array of strings): For `script_path` (passes to `on run argv` / `run(argv)`). For `kb_script_id`, used for positional args (e.g., `--MCP_ARG_1`).\n\n**3. Execution Options (Optional):**\n*   `language` ('applescript' | 'javascript'): Specify for `script_content`/`script_path` (default: 'applescript'). Inferred for `kb_script_id`.\n*   `timeout_seconds` (integer, optional, default: 60): Sets the maximum time (in seconds) the script is allowed to run. Increase for potentially long-running operations.\n*   `output_format_mode` (enum, optional, default: 'auto'): Controls `osascript` output formatting.\n    *   `'auto'`: Smart default - resolves to `'human_readable'` for AppleScript and `'direct'` for JXA.\n    *   `'human_readable'`: For AppleScript, uses `-s h` flag.\n    *   `'structured_error'`: For AppleScript, uses `-s s` flag (structured errors).\n    *   `'structured_output_and_error'`: For AppleScript, uses `-s ss` flag (structured output & errors).\n    *   `'direct'`: No special output flags (recommended for JXA).\n*   `include_executed_script_in_output` (boolean, optional, default: false): If `true`, the final script content (after any placeholder substitutions) or script path that was executed will be included in the response. This is useful for debugging and understanding exactly what was run. Defaults to false.\n*   `include_substitution_logs` (boolean, default: false): For `kb_script_id`, includes detailed placeholder substitution logs.\n*   `report_execution_time` (boolean, optional, default: false): If `true`, an additional message with the formatted script execution time will be included in the response. Defaults to false.\n"

        "description": "Discover how to automate any app on your Mac with this comprehensive knowledge base of AppleScript/JXA tips and runnable scripts. This tool is essential for discovery and should be the FIRST CHOICE when aiming to automate macOS tasks, especially those involving common applications or system functions, before attempting to write scripts from scratch. It helps identify pre-built, tested solutions, effectively teaching you how to control virtually any aspect of your macOS experience.\n\n**Primary Use Cases & Parameters:**\n\n*   **Discovering Solutions (Use `search_term`):**\n    *   Parameter: `search_term` (string, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Performs a fuzzy search across all tip titles, descriptions, keywords, script content, and IDs. Ideal for natural language queries like \"how to...\" (e.g., `search_term: \"how do I get the current Safari URL and title?\"`). This is the most common way to find relevant tips.\n    *   Output: Returns a list of matching tips in Markdown format.\n\n*   **Limiting Search Results (Use `limit`):**\n    *   Parameter: `limit` (integer, optional, default: 10).\n    *   Functionality: Specifies the maximum number of script tips to return when using `search_term` or browsing a specific `category` (without `list_categories: true`). Does not apply if `list_categories` is true.\n\n*   **Browsing by Category (Use `category`):**\n    *   Parameter: `category` (string, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Shows tips from a specific category. Combine with `limit` to control result count.\n    *   Example: `category: \"01_intro\"` or `category: \"07_browsers/chrome\"`.\n\n*   **Listing All Categories (Use `list_categories: true`):**\n    *   Parameter: `list_categories` (boolean, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Returns a structured list of all available categories with their descriptions. This helps you understand what automation areas are covered.\n    *   Output: Category tree in Markdown format.\n\n*   **Refreshing Database (Use `refresh_database: true`):**\n    *   Parameter: `refresh_database` (boolean, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Forces a reload of the knowledge base if new scripts have been added. Typically not needed as the database refreshes automatically.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n1. **Always start with search**: Use natural language queries to find solutions (e.g., \"send email from Mail app\").\n2. **Browse categories when exploring**: Use `list_categories: true` to see available automation areas.\n3. **Use specific IDs for execution**: Once you find a script, use its ID with `execute_script` tool for precise execution."

Apply any combination of filters (tags, lists, folders, spaces, statuses, etc.)\n2. Use pagination to manage large result sets\n3. Include subtasks by setting subtasks=true\n\nRequirements:\n- At least one filter parameter is REQUIRED (tags, list_ids, folder_ids, space_ids, statuses, assignees, or date filters)\n- Pagination parameters (page, order_by, reverse) alone are not considered filters\n\nNotes:\n- Provides workspace-wide task access (unlike get_tasks which only searches in one list)\n- Returns complete task details including descriptions, assignees, custom fields, and all metadata\n- Tag filtering is especially useful for cross-list organization (e.g., \"project-x\", \"blocker\", \"needs-review\")\n- Combine multiple filters to narrow down your search scope\n- Use pagination for large result sets\n- Set subtasks=true to include subtask details in the response\n  IMPORTANT: subtasks=true enables subtasks to appear in results, but subtasks must still match your other filter criteria (tags, lists, etc.) to be returned. To see all subtasks of a specific task regardless of filters, use the get_task tool with subtasks=true instead.\n- Use the detail_level parameter to control the amount of data returned:\n  - \"summary\": Returns lightweight task data (name, status, list, tags)\n  - \"detailed\": Returns complete task data with all fields (DEFAULT if not specified)\n- Responses exceeding 50,000 tokens automatically switch to summary format to avoid hitting LLM token limits\n"

ALWAYS get the schema of the dataset before running queries rather than guessing.\n    You can do this by getting a single event and projecting all fields.\n3. Keep in mind that there's a maximum row limit of 65000 rows per query.\n4. Prefer aggregations over non aggregating queries when possible to reduce the amount of data returned.\n5. Be selective in what you project in each query (unless otherwise needed, like for discovering the schema).\n    It's expensive to project all fields.\n6. ALWAYS restrict the time range of the query to the smallest possible range that\n    meets your needs. This will reduce the amount of data scanned and improve query performance.\n7. NEVER guess the schema of the dataset. If you don't where something is, use search first to find in which fields\n    it appears.\n\n# Examples\nBasic:\n- Filter: ['logs'] | where ['severity'] == \"error\" or ['duration'] > 500ms\n- Time range: ['logs'] | where ['_time'] > ago(2h) and ['_time'] < now()\n- Project rename: ['logs'] | project-rename responseTime=['duration'], path=['url']\n\nAggregations:\n- Count by: ['logs'] | summarize count() by bin(['_time'], 5m), ['status']\n- Multiple aggs: ['logs'] | summarize count(), avg(['duration']), max(['duration']), p95=percentile(['duration'], 95) by ['endpoint']\n- Dimensional: ['logs'] | summarize dimensional_analysis(['isError'], pack_array(['endpoint'], ['status']))\n- Histograms: ['logs'] | summarize histogram(['responseTime'], 100) by ['endpoint']\n- Distinct: ['logs'] | summarize dcount(['userId']) by bin_auto(['_time'])\n\nSearch & Parse:\n- Search all: search \"error\" or \"exception\"\n- Parse logs: ['logs'] | parse-kv ['message'] as (duration:long, error:string) with (pair_delimiter=\",\")\n- Regex extract: ['logs'] | extend errorCode = extract(\"error code ([0-9]+)\", 1, ['message'])\n- Contains ops: ['logs'] | where ['message'] contains_cs \"ERROR\" or ['message'] startswith \"FATAL\"\n\nData Shaping:\n- Extend & Calculate: ['logs'] | extend duration_s = ['duration']/1000, success = ['status'] < 400\n- Dynamic: ['logs'] | extend props = parse_json(['properties']) | where ['props.level'] == \"error\"\n- Pack/Unpack: ['logs'] | extend fields = pack(\"status\", ['status'], \"duration\", ['duration'])\n- Arrays: ['logs'] | where ['url'] in (\"login\", \"logout\", \"home\") | where array_length(['tags']) > 0\n\nAdvanced:\n- Make series: ['metrics'] | make-series avg(['cpu']) default=0 on ['_time'] step 1m by ['host']\n- Join: ['errors'] | join kind=inner (['users'] | project ['userId'], ['email']) on ['userId']\n- Union: union ['logs-app*'] | where ['severity'] == \"error\"\n- Fork: ['logs'] | fork (where ['status'] >= 500 | as errors) (where ['status'] < 300 | as success)\n- Case: ['logs'] | extend level = case(['status'] >= 500, \"error\", ['status'] >= 400, \"warn\", \"info\")\n\nTime Operations:\n- Bin & Range: ['logs'] | where ['_time'] between(datetime(2024-01-01)..now())\n- Multiple time bins: ['logs'] | summarize count() by bin(['_time'], 1h), bin(['_time'], 1d)\n- Time shifts: ['logs'] | extend prev_hour = ['_time'] - 1h\n\nString Operations:\n- String funcs: ['logs'] | extend domain = tolower(extract(\"://([^/]+)\", 1, ['url']))\n- Concat: ['logs'] | extend full_msg = strcat(['level'], \": \", ['message'])\n- Replace: ['logs'] | extend clean_msg = replace_regex(\"(password=)[^&]*\", \"\\1***\", ['message'])\n\nCommon Patterns:\n- Error analysis: ['logs'] | where ['severity'] == \"error\" | summarize error_count=count() by ['error_code'], ['service']\n- Status codes: ['logs'] | summarize requests=count() by ['status'], bin_auto(['_time']) | where ['status'] >= 500\n- Latency tracking: ['logs'] | summarize p50=percentile(['duration'], 50), p90=percentile(['duration'], 90) by ['endpoint']\n- User activity: ['logs'] | summarize user_actions=count() by ['userId'], ['action'], bin(['_time'], 1h)"

This tool will programmatically extract all translations into a structured JSON file, preserving nested objects, arrays, template variables, and formatting. This helps keep translations as configuration and prevents filling up the AI context window with translation content. By default, the source file will be replaced with \"MIGRATED TO <target absolute path>\" and a warning message after successful extraction, making it easy to track where the data was moved to. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the DISABLE_SOURCE_REPLACEMENT environment variable to 'true'. The warning message can be customized by setting the WARNING_MESSAGE environment variable."

See the qualifiers and their usage examples:\n\n- **book**  \n  `book:Blog`: Searches for notes in the 'Blog' notebook.\n  `book:\"Desktop App\"`: Searches for notes in the 'Desktop App' notebook.\n- **bookId**\n  `bookId:kGlLniaV`: Searches for notes in the notebook ID 'book:kGlLniaV'.\n- **tag**  \n  `tag:JavaScript`: Searches for all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag. Read more about [tags](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/write-notes#tag-notes).\n- **status**  \n  `status:onHold`: Searches for all notes with the 'On hold' status. Read more about [statuses](/reference/note-statuses).\n- **title**  \n  `title:\"JavaScript setTimeout\"`: Searches for the note with the specified title.\n- **body**  \n  `body:KEYWORD`: Searches for a specific word in all notes. Equivalent to a [global search](#search-for-notes-across-all-notebooks).\n\n### Combine qualifiers\n\nYou can combine the filter qualifiers to refine data even more.\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Hello' and have the 'Issue' tag.**\n\n```text\nHello tag:Issue\n```\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Typescript,' have the 'Contribution' tag, and the 'Completed' status**\n\n```text\nTypescript tag:Contribution status:Completed\n```\n\n## Search for text with spaces\n\nTo find the text that includes spaces, put the text into the double quotation marks (\"):\n\n```text\n\"database associations\"\n```\n\n## Exclude text from search\n\nTo exclude text from the search results or ignore a specific qualifier, put the minus sign (-) before it. You can also combine the exclusions. See the examples:\n\n- `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`: Ignores the 'Backend' notebook while searching for the 'closure functions' phrase.\n- `-tag:JavaScript`: Ignores all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag.\n- `-book:Typescript tag:work \"Data types\"`: Ignores the 'Typescript' notebook and the 'work' tag while searching for the 'Data types' phrase.\n- `-status:dropped title:\"Sprint 10.0\" debounce`: Ignores notes with the 'Dropped' status while searching for the 'debounce' word in the note with the 'Sprint 10.0' title.\n- `-\"Phrase to ignore\" \"in the rest of a sentence\"`: Ignores the 'Phrase to ignore' part while searching for 'in the rest of a sentence'.\n\nNote that you can't specify excluding modifiers only without including conditions.\n\n**WARNING**: Make sure to enter a text to search for after the exclusion modifier.\n\n- ✅ Will work  \n  `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`\n\n- ⛔️ Won't work  \n   `-book:Backend`.

        "description": "Register a new user request and plan its associated tasks. You must provide 'originalRequest' and 'tasks', and optionally 'splitDetails'.\n\nTasks can now include subtasks, which are smaller units of work that make up a task. All subtasks must be completed before a task can be marked as done.\n\nYou can also include:\n- 'dependencies': List of project or task-specific dependencies (libraries, tools, etc.)\n- 'notes': General notes about the project (preferences, guidelines, etc.)\n- 'outputPath': Path to save a Markdown file with the task plan for reference. It's recommended to use absolute paths (e.g., 'C:/Users/username/Documents/task-plan.md') rather than relative paths for more reliable file creation.\n\nThis tool initiates a new workflow for handling a user's request. The workflow is as follows:\n1. Use 'plan_task' to register a request and its tasks (with optional subtasks, dependencies, and notes).\n2. After adding tasks, you MUST use 'get_next_task' to retrieve the first task. A progress table will be displayed.\n3. Use 'get_next_task' to retrieve the next uncompleted task.\n4. If the task has subtasks, complete each subtask using 'mark_subtask_done' before marking the task as done.\n5. **IMPORTANT:** After marking a task as done, a progress table will be displayed showing the updated status of all tasks. The assistant MUST NOT proceed to another task without the user's approval. The user must explicitly approve the completed task.\n6. Once a task is approved, you can proceed to 'get_next_task' again to fetch the next pending task.\n7. Repeat this cycle until all tasks are done.\n8. After all tasks are completed (and approved), 'get_next_task' will indicate that all tasks are done and that the request awaits approval for full completion.\n9. The user must then approve the entire request's completion. If the user does not approve and wants more tasks, you can again use 'plan_task' to add new tasks and continue the cycle.\n\nThe critical point is to always wait for user approval after completing each task and after all tasks are done, wait for request completion approval. Do not proceed automatically."
