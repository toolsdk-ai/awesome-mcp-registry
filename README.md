# Awesome MCP Registry

An Open, Structured, and Standard Registry for MCP Servers and Packages.

Compare to other MCP projects and registry sites, the **Awesome MCP Registry** uses structured JSON files to keep a large number of MCP projects.

With these JSON files, it automatically creates:

- `@toolsdk.ai/registry`: A npm package can be installed all MCP registry via `npm install @toolsdk.ai/registry`.
- **README.md**: AI generated a great `README.md` in multi-languages.
- **packages-list.json**: Get a full list of all MCP servers and packages by running `curl https://toolsdk-ai.github.io/awesome-mcp-registry/collections/packages-list.json`.

You can use the Awesome MCP Registry to build your own great MCP projects and hosting sites, acting as the main source for MCP servers and packages.
